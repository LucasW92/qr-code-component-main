## My process

Since this was my first project, first I took some time to understand the containers involved.
After that i created the first div and the second div for the text.
Finally, i proceeded to apply the font stylings and tried to center the objects in the scrren with the help of flexbox and grid.

### Built with

HTML5 and CSS

### What I learned

I've learned alot about basic CSS, specially about positioning items with flex and grid.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on improving my ability to correctly use flexbox and grid, since this was were I faced most problems while trying to solve the challenge.
